# UnityInputResources
A collection of Unity Input Resources. Unity's stock input system is... lackluster. These are my recommendations. The list used to be a lot longer, but really there's only 2 options at this point.

## Free

[**XInput for Homebrew** (XInputDotNet by speps)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/manual/QuickStartGuide.html)

## Paid

[**Input System (XInput, Abstraction, and Console Support)** (**$45** - Rewired by Guavaman Enterprises)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/rewired-21676)
